Portfolleo is a Simple, Intuitive Portfolio Plugin for wordpress that creates a very good-looking portfolio that uses JQuery. It is very very very easy to use and is quite fast. I created it because there really wasn't any plugin that just created a whole portfolio, that looks amazing. So, thats what Portfolleo does, it creates an amazing portfolio almost without any input from the user. Its also highly customizable.

This plugin is very simple. Portfolleo is a plugin that was designed from
the ground up to be very easy to use. It creates a very sophisticated portfolio
that uses jquery, you don't have to do anything regarding jquery or html.

To use:

  1. Put the 'Portfolleo' folder in your 'plugins' folder in your wordpress directory.

> 2) Go into the wordpress admin panel and active the plugin the plugin in the plugins pane.

> 3) Create a page called 'portfolio' and put <img src='http://img.skitch.com/20091114-jx75q5yi3j9p4us8uq33gf9kyn.png' alt=' ' /> in it, this is very important.

> 4) Go to the Portfolleo pane, the link should be in the nav menu in the wordpress admin panel.

> 5) Add your first portfolio item, e.g. Name => Portfolleo, Date Completed => 11/11/09. Description => An Amazing Plugin.
